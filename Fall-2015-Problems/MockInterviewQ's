Single Number
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory? 

Reverse a linked list
You have to complete the Node* Reverse(Node* head) method which takes one argument - the head of the linked list. 
Change the next pointers of the nodes that their order is reversed and return the head of the reversed linked list.
Note:
Empty list remains empty
List is reversed from 2,3 to 3,2
