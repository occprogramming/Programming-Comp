Problem 1: Number Letter Count

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used? 



Problem 2: Crack the Hash

The hash is either a 0 to 6 digit number or a three letter lower case string.
Hash output will be the exact same on each computer.  Different hash for each input.  

Example: 
			int k = 123456;
			hash<int> h;
			const size_t value = h(k);
			output = 859409398
			

Now crack the hash: 108289031


The Code you will need to use:

#include <string>
hash<string> h;
const size_t value = h(i);
